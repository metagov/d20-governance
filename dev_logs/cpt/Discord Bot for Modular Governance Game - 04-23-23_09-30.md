# Architecting a System for a Discord Bot: Master Plan

## Overview
Our goal is to architect a system for a Discord bot that facilitates a game where players experiment with modular governance as a way of making collective decisions in an unstable communication environment. The bot will be built using the following tech stack:
- discordpy v2
- Python
- Poetry
- YAML

The bot will be used to start and facilitate quests, which are games played by groups of users focused on different objectives.

## Task List
1. Define the governance stack with four modules: culture, decision, structure, and process.
    - Define a class `GovernanceStack` with an `__init__()` method that initializes the culture, decision, structure, and process modules.
    - Define a class `CultureModule` with an `__init__()` method that initializes the linguistic constraint.
    - Define a class `DecisionModule` with an `__init__()` method that defines the mechanism for making a decision.
    - Define a class `StructureModule` with an `__init__()` method that defines the organization conditions for making decisions.
    - Define a class `ProcessModule` with an `__init__()` method that defines the process for discussing proposals before making decisions.

2. Create YAML files to define quests with stages, tasks, and timers.
    - Define a class `Quest` with properties for the name, number of players, and YAML definition file.
    - Define a `load_quests()` function that reads the YAML quest definition files and creates a list of `Quest` objects.

3. Define a public channel, d20-agora, that is made when the bot is invited to the server.
    - Define a `create_channel()` function that creates a public `discord.TextChannel` named `d20-agora`.

4. Allow users to use d20-agora to experiment and learn about different culture and decision modules using a bot command.
    - Define a bot command `!explore` that lists the available culture and decision modules and their descriptions.
    - Define an `explore()` function that sends the `!explore` message to the d20-agora channel.

5. Set up a join button for users to join a quest.
    - Define a `join()` button with the type of quest and the number of players needed to start the game.

6. Start a quest with a bot command that prompts the user to select the particular quest they want to play from a list of options and the number of players that need to join for the game to start.
    - Define a bot command `!start` that lists the available quest options and prompts the user to select one and provide the number of players needed to start the game.
    - Define a `start()` function that creates a new `Quest` object, sends a message with the selected quest and the number of players needed, and prompts users to click the `join()` button to sign up for the quest.

7. Create a new private channel appended with the quest name, a randomly generated string, and the number of players once the required number of users have clicked the join button. This channel is where the quest will be played.
    - Define a `create_quest_channel()` function that creates a private `discord.VoiceChannel` named "{quest name}-{random string}-{number of players}" for the selected `Quest` object.
    - Define a `join_quest_channel()` function that moves the bot and all players who clicked the `join()` button to the new quest voice channel.

8. Develop a command for players to submit proposals, vote on proposals, and complete other necessary game actions.
    - Define a bot command `!proposal` that allows players to submit proposals.
    - Define a bot command `!vote` that allows players to vote on proposals.

9. Automate the game by having the Discord bot check the game state and progress the game based on stage completion and timer triggers.
    - Define a `run_quest()` function that automatically checks the game state and progresses through the stages and tasks based on timer triggers.

10. Develop a way to end the game and display the results of the completed quest.
    - Define a `end_quest()` function that ends the quest, displays the results, and deletes the quest voice channel.

11. Test and debug the system to ensure smooth operation and timely progress through quests.

### **assistant**:

Got it! I've reviewed the plan and task list. It looks like you have a well-organized and comprehensive plan for architecting a system for a Discord bot that facilitates a game where players experiment with modular governance as a way of making collective decisions.

You have defined the governance stack with four modules: culture, decision, structure, and process, and have created classes to initialize these modules. You have also created YAML files to define quests with stages, tasks, and timers, and defined a public channel for users to experiment with different culture and decision modules using a bot command.

You have also set up a join button for users to join a quest and created a way to start a quest with a bot command that prompts the user to select the particular quest they want to play from a list of options and the number of players that need to join for the game to start. Once the required number of users have clicked the join button, you have also created a new private channel appended with the quest name, a randomly generated string, and the number of players, where the quest will be played.

You have developed functions for players to submit proposals, vote on proposals, and complete other necessary game actions, and you have automated the game by having the Discord bot check the game state and progress the game based on stage completion and timer triggers.

Lastly, you have developed a way to end the game and display the results of the completed quest, and plan to test and debug the system to ensure smooth operation and timely progress through quests.

It seems like a great plan, and I'm confident you'll be able to implement it successfully. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

### **user**:

write an example implementation of task 3

---

### **assistant**:

Certainly! Here is an example implementation of Task 3, which involves defining a public channel, `d20-agora`, that is made when the bot is invited to the server:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    # Create public channel when bot is invited to server
    guild = bot.guilds[0]  # grab the first server the bot is in
    overwrites = {
        guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=False),
        guild.me: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True)
    }
    channel = await guild.create_text_channel("d20-agora", overwrites=overwrites)
    print("Public channel created:", channel.name)

bot.run('your-token-goes-here')
```

In this example, we are using the `discord.py` library to create a Discord bot. When the bot is started, we define an `on_ready()` event listener function that is called when the bot is ready to start processing events. In this function, we grab the first server the bot is in and create a new text channel called "d20-agora". We assign the default role with read permissions set to `False` for this channel, while giving the bot account read permissions set to `True`.

Once the channel is created, we print out a message to confirm that the public channel was created successfully.

Please note that this is just an example implementation, and you will need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements.

---

### **user**:

modify the code to check if there is already a channel names d20-agora. if d20-agora already exists do not do anything. if it doesn't exist create it. also make the channel readable and writable for default role

---

### **assistant**:

Sure, here's an example implementation of how to modify the code to check if a channel named "d20-agora" already exists on the server before creating a new one:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    # Check if public channel already exists
    guild = bot.guilds[0]
    channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name="d20-agora")
    if channel:
        print("Public channel already exists:", channel.name)
    else:
        # Create public channel if it doesn't exist
        overwrites = {
            guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True)
        }
        channel = await guild.create_text_channel("d20-agora", overwrites=overwrites)
        print("Public channel created:", channel.name)

bot.run('your-token-goes-here')
```

In this example, we first look for the `d20-agora` text channel using `discord.utils.get()` and assign it to the `channel` variable. If this channel already exists, we print out a message indicating that it's already there.

If the channel doesn't exist, we create a new text channel named "d20-agora" with `guild.create_text_channel()`. To make it readable and writable for the default role, we define an `overwrites` dictionary with the default role and set `read_messages` and `send_messages` to `True`.

Once the channel is created or we confirm it already exists, we print out a message to confirm the channel status.

Please note that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.

### **user**:

modify the code except to also create a three new categories named d20-explore, d20-play, and d20-archive. the channel d20-agora should go inside d20-explore. the other two categories should be empty 

---

### **assistant**:

Certainly, here's an example implementation of how to modify the code to create three new categories named `d20-explore`, `d20-play`, and `d20-archive`. The `d20-agora` channel should be nested under the `d20-explore` category, while the other two categories should be empty:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

async def setup_channel(guild, name, category=None, overwrites=None):
    if overwrites is None:
        overwrites = {}
    if not category:
        category = await guild.create_category(name)
        print(f"Created category '{name}'")
    channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name=name)
    if channel:
        print(f"Channel '{name}' already exists")
    else:
        channel = await guild.create_text_channel(name, overwrites=overwrites, category=category)
        print(f"Created channel '{name}' under category '{category.name}'")
    return channel

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    guild = bot.guilds[0]

    # Create category channels if they don't exist
    explore_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-explore')
    if not explore_category:
        explore_category = await guild.create_category('d20-explore')
        print("Created category 'd20-explore'")
    play_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-play')
    if not play_category:
        play_category = await guild.create_category('d20-play')
        print("Created category 'd20-play'")
    archive_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-archive')
    if not archive_category:
        archive_category = await guild.create_category('d20-archive')
        print("Created category 'd20-archive'")

    # Create d20-agora channel under d20-explore category
    overwrites = {
        guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True)
    }
    agora_channel = await setup_channel(guild, 'd20-agora', explore_category, overwrites)

bot.run('your-token-goes-here')
```

In this example, we create a new `setup_channel()` function that creates a text channel with the specified name, category, and overwrites. If the specified category doesn't exist, it creates a new category with the specified name. The channel is assigned the specified overwrites, and if it doesn't exist, a new text channel is created with the specified name under the specified category.

Inside the `on_ready()` event listener function, we first look for the `d20-explore`, `d20-play`, and `d20-archive` categories using `discord.utils.get()`. If any of these categories don't exist, we create them using the `create_category()` method. We then define `overwrites` for the `d20-agora` channel with `read_messages` and `send_messages` permissions set to `True`.

Finally, we call the `setup_channel()` function to create the `d20-agora` channel under the `d20-explore` category with the specified overwrites.

Please note that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements.

### **user**:

is it possible to rewrite this code so that everything happens in the on_ready event instead of calling the setup_channel function?

---

### **assistant**:

Yes, it is definitely possible to rewrite the code so that everything happens in the `on_ready()` event listener function. Here's an example of how you can do so:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    guild = bot.guilds[0]

    # Create category channels if they don't exist
    explore_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-explore')
    if not explore_category:
        explore_category = await guild.create_category('d20-explore')
        print("Created category 'd20-explore'")
    play_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-play')
    if not play_category:
        play_category = await guild.create_category('d20-play')
        print("Created category 'd20-play'")
    archive_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-archive')
    if not archive_category:
        archive_category = await guild.create_category('d20-archive')
        print("Created category 'd20-archive'")

    # Create d20-agora channel under d20-explore category
    overwrites = {
        guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True)
    }
    agora_channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name='d20-agora')
    if not agora_channel:
        agora_channel = await guild.create_text_channel('d20-agora', overwrites=overwrites, category=explore_category)
        print(f"Created channel '{agora_channel.name}' under category '{explore_category.name}'")
    else:
        print(f"Channel '{agora_channel.name}' already exists under category '{explore_category.name}'")
    
bot.run('your-token-goes-here')
```

In this version of the code, we create the category channels, and then use `discord.utils.get()` to look for the `d20-agora` text channel. If it exists, we print out a message to confirm that it exists. If it does not exist, we create it using `guild.create_text_channel()` and assign it the specified name, overwrites, and category.

By eliminating the `setup_channel()` function, we can include all of the channel creation logic inside the `on_ready()` function, making it more streamlined.

Please note that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements.

### **user**:

Modify the guild variable to check every server the bot is online in

---

### **assistant**:

Sure, here's an example of how to modify the `guild` variable to check every server the bot is online in:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    # Loop through all servers the bot is in
    for guild in bot.guilds:
        # Create category channels if they don't exist
        explore_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-explore')
        if not explore_category:
            explore_category = await guild.create_category('d20-explore')
            print(f"Created category 'd20-explore' in server '{guild.name}'")
        play_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-play')
        if not play_category:
            play_category = await guild.create_category('d20-play')
            print(f"Created category 'd20-play' in server '{guild.name}'")
        archive_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-archive')
        if not archive_category:
            archive_category = await guild.create_category('d20-archive')
            print(f"Created category 'd20-archive' in server '{guild.name}'")

        # Create d20-agora channel under d20-explore category
        overwrites = {
            guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True)
        }
        agora_channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name='d20-agora')
        if not agora_channel:
            agora_channel = await guild.create_text_channel('d20-agora', overwrites=overwrites, category=explore_category)
            print(f"Created channel '{agora_channel.name}' under category '{exp

### **user**:

rewrite this command to trigger when bot is invited to and joins a server for the first time

---

### **assistant**:

Sure, here's an example of how to rewrite the command to trigger when the bot is invited to and joins a server for the first time:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

async def setup_server(guild):
    for category_name in ["d20-explore", "d20-play", "d20-archive"]:
        # Create category channels if they don't exist
        category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name=category_name)
        if not category:
            category = await guild.create_category(category_name)
            print(f"Created category '{category_name}' in server '{guild.name}'")

    # Create d20-agora channel under d20-explore category
    explore_category = discord.utils.get(guild.categories, name='d20-explore')
    overwrites = {
        guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True)
    }
    agora_channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name='d20-agora')
    if not agora_channel:
        agora_channel = await guild.create_text_channel('d20-agora', overwrites=overwrites, category=explore_category)
        print(f"Created channel '{agora_channel.name}' under category '{explore_category.name}' in server '{guild.name}'")
    else:
        print(f"Channel '{agora_channel.name}' already exists under category '{explore_category.name}' in server '{guild.name}'")

@bot.event
async def on_guild_join(guild):
    await setup_server(guild)
    print(f"Bot has been invited to server '{guild.name}'")

bot.run('your-token-goes-here')
```

In this version of the code, we define a new `setup_server()` function that checks if the specified category channels exist, and creates them if they don't. We then assign the `overwrites` dictionary for the `d20-agora` channel to make it accessible to the default role.

Inside the `on_guild_join()` event listener function, we call the `setup_server()` function to create the necessary channels and categories for the new server. We also print out a message to confirm that the bot has been invited to the server.

By using the `on_guild_join()` event, we can ensure that the server setup logic only runs when the bot is invited to a new server for the first time. Once it has been set up, it will not run again if the bot is removed and re-invited to the same server.

Please note that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements.
