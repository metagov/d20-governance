    You are tasked with building a new community from scratch and have three questions to collectively answer. However, this simulation takes place in the future, after a ðŸ¤” **new confusion** ðŸ¤” has set in. Deliberation on the internet is now randomly subjected to communication collapses ðŸ˜±.\n\n
    
    While things may at first appear normal, over time you will experience new challenges in making decisions. Be prepared to adapt or risk remaining in the new confusion for forever!"

    This simulation was  meant to demonstrate the types of ways communication might be affected in this game, how those distortions impact the baility to deliberate, and how decisions might be made.\n\n

    In future simulations or complete quests, you will explore how to self-govern by changing how you make decisions, the processes you follow when deliberating decisions, and how to deal with failed proposals.\n\n
    
    Thanks for playing."
