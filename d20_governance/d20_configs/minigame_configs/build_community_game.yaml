  - stage: Introduction
    message: >-
      Welcome to the Build a Community Governance Simulator!
      
        You are tasked with building a new community from scratch and have three questions to collectively answer. 
        
        However, this simulation takes place in the future, after a 🤔 **new confusion** 🤔 has set in. Deliberation on the internet is now randomly subjected to communication collapses 😱.
        
        While things may at first appear normal, over time you will experience new challenges in making decisions. 
        
        Be prepared to adapt or risk remaining in the new confusion for forever!"

  - stage: Community Name
    message: >-
      The first step in building a community and making sense of our situation is to give it a name.

        What should we call ourselves?

      Take a moment to submit a proposal to the question: `What should we call ourselves?`.

        You have 2 minutes to submit an answer.

        To submit your proposal, type `/submit` followed by your message.
        
        For example: `/submit this is my submission`

        If you make a mistake or change your mine you can use `/resubmit` to change your submission.

        See `/help submit` for more information.

        The simulator has returned to interfere with the deliberation process. This time, a culture of obscurity is in place.
        
        It seems as though the simulator is responsive to the challenges of consensus, and is making communication more challenging than before.
        
        Deliberation must now commence. 
        
        **Remember, you must all vote for the same option, otherwise you will fail the game!** 
        
        Good luck reaching consensus!

      Congratulations on completing this first experience in online governance in this new world.

       This simulation was  meant to demonstrate the types of ways communication might be affected in this game, how those distortions impact the baility to deliberate, and how decisions might be made.

       In future simulations or complete quests, you will explore how to self-govern by changing how you make decisions, the processes you follow when deliberating decisions, and how to deal with failed proposals.

       Thanks for playing.
